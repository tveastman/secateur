<p>If you don't want Secateur to block the accounts of people you follow, you can tell it not to <a href="{% url "following" %}">on this page</a>.</p>

<h2>Blocking accounts using secateur</h2>

    <p>
        Secateur blocks a user and all their followers, and it can automatically unblock them later
        after a time of your choosing. If secateur is under heavy load, then it can take a while for blocking to start.
    </p>
    <p>
        There's a rate-limit that affects how many people you can block. It works just like a stamina bar in a game:
        it refills slowly over time up to a maximum. The maximum and the speed at which it refills are things I tune
        every once in a while depending on how overloaded the server is.
    </p>
    <p>
        Important note: <b>If you change your Twitter screen name, Secateur won't work for you anymore</b> until you
        log in again. The credentials Secateur users are tied to your Twitter username. If you change your screen name
        secateur can't unblock or block users for you until you log into to secateur with your new screen name.
    </p>
    <p>Muting people is way, way slower than blocking them, and you can't mute many people. I recommend just using 'block'
    and 'block followers' and not using mute at all on secateur (I intend to move mute to its own page later).</p>
