    <h2>February 2023</h2>

    <p>
        Elon Musk is destroying the free access to the Twitter API. As of the 13th of February access to the Twitter API
        will cost $100 USD per month. This is a <strong>massive</strong> increase in the cost of running Secateur.
        Secateur is supported by donations, that's how I pay for the server costs.
    </p>
    <div class="alert alert-warning" role="alert">
        <strong>If donations can't keep pace with the server costs, I'll eventually have to shut Secateur down.</strong>
    </div>
    <p>Secateur has sixty-five thousand users. If you can't afford to donate, that's totally fine, I'm going to keep
    the site running until I can't anymore. But if Secateur has helped you, and you can afford a dollar or two a month, <a href="https://www.patreon.com/bePatron?u=576672">sign
    up for the Patreon</a>. <strong>It'll only take a handful of users out of sixty-five thousand to keep the site online.</strong>
    </p>

<h2>Blocking accounts using Secateur</h2>

    <p>
        Secateur blocks a user and all their followers, and it can automatically unblock them later
        after a time of your choosing. If Secateur is under heavy load, then it can take a while for blocking to start.
    </p>
    <p>
        There's a rate-limit that affects how many people you can block. It works just like a stamina bar in a game:
        it refills slowly over time up to a maximum. The maximum and the speed at which it refills are things I tune
        every once in a while depending on how overloaded the server is.
    </p>
    <p>
        Important note: <b>If you change your Twitter screen name, Secateur won't work for you anymore</b> until you
        log in again. The credentials Secateur users are tied to your Twitter username. If you change your screen name
        Secateur can't unblock or block users for you until you log into to Secateur with your new screen name.
    </p>
    <p>Muting people is way, way slower than blocking them, and you can't mute many people. I recommend just using 'block'
    and 'block followers' and not using mute at all on Secateur (I intend to move mute to its own page later).</p>

  <h2>Support</h2>

    <p>
        As of February 2023, <b>Secateur has blocked 2.5 billion Twitter accounts</b>  on behalf of over
        sixty-five thousand users. It costs me a couple hundred dollars per month to run. I need your help
        to keep it going.
    </p>
